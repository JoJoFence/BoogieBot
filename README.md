# BoogieBot
The development of a collaborative robotics system for STEM education. Each student would set up their own BoogieBot, use the GUI to control them, and upon driving up to a friend's robot (and recognizing it via a QR code), would be able to code a dance routine via an integrated Blockly interface in the GUI and send it to their friend's robot.
